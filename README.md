# Transformer
Let's train our transformer! Here we have a complete transformer implementation
with some sneaky optimizations to make training easier (since we are paying for
GPUs, we should be maximizing our value!). 

## Lambda Labs
We will be training on either H100 or H200 GPU(s) (depending on what your budget is).
Before we can start, you will need to:
1. Create a LambdaLabs account
2. Set up your billing information
3. Create an SSH key and save it
